### Steps to Set Up X509 Certificate Authentication

```
mkdir newusercrt
cd newusercrt 
openssl genrsa --out sangam.key 2048
openssl req -new -key sangam.key -out sangam.csr -subj "/CN=sangam/O=group1"
```

This creates a private key (sangam.key) and a CSR (sangam.csr). The CN (Common Name) is set to the user's name, and O (Organization) is an optional field to specify a group.

### Create a CertificateSigningRequest in Kubernetes

Encode the CSR in base64 and create a YAML file for the Kubernetes CSR object:

```
cat sangam.csr | base64 | tr -d '\n'

#### sangam-csr.yaml with following content 

cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1
kind: CertificateSigningRequest
metadata:
  name: sangam
spec:
  groups:
  - system:authenticated
  request: $(cat sangam.csr | base64 | tr -d "\n")
  signerName: kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client
  usages:
  - client auth

output 

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -

  request: $(cat sangam.csr | base64 | tr -d "\n")
  signerName: kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client
  usages:
  - client auth
EOF
certificatesigningrequest.certificates.k8s.io/sangam created

```

#### check csr with kubectl 

```
➜  newusercrt git:(main) ✗ kubectl get csr
NAME     AGE   SIGNERNAME                            REQUESTOR       REQUESTEDDURATION   CONDITION
sangam   57s   kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client   minikube-user   <none>              Pending
```

#### Approve the CSR in Kubernetes

List CSRs and approve yours:

```
  newusercrt git:(main) ✗ kubectl certificate approve sangam
certificatesigningrequest.certificates.k8s.io/sangam approved
```

### Retrieve the Signed Certificate

Once approved, retrieve the signed certificate from the CSR:

```
kubectl get csr sangam  -o jsonpath='{.status.certificate}' | base64 --decode > sangam.crt

```

### Set up kubectl for the User

Configure kubectl to use the certificate:

```
 kubectl config set-credentials sangam --client-certificate=sangam.crt --client-key=sangam.key
kubectl config set-context sangam --cluster=minikube --user=sangam
User "sangam" set.
Context "sangam" created.

```

 Now it is time to create context so that the new user can use the cluster. I will name the context as sangam-context. You can name differently as you wish.

```
 kubectl config set-context sangam-context --cluster=minikube --user=sangam

Context "sangam-context" created.

``` 

### Test the Configuration

Switch to the new context and test:

```
kubectl config use-context sangam-context
 kubectl get nodes
Error from server (Forbidden): nodes is forbidden: User "sangam" cannot list resource "nodes" in API group "" at the cluster scope

```


pod-reader-role.yaml
```

  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader

  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]

```

```

```
 kubectl config use-context minikube
 kubectl apply -f pod-reader-role.yaml
kubectl apply -f readpods-rolebinding.yaml
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/pod-reader created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/read-pods created
```

## run test ngnix pod 
```
 kubectl run test2 --image=nginx
pod/test2 created
kubectl get pods
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
test2   1/1     Running   0          49s


kubectl config use-context sangam-context
Switched to context "sangam-context".

 kubectl get pods
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
test2   1/1     Running   0          2m1s


kubectl run test3 --image=nginx
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "sangam" cannot create resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "default"


you would have more robust systems for managing certificates.
The kubectl commands assume that Minikube is your current context and you have the necessary permissions to perform these actions.
The certificate signing process in a real-world scenario might involve additional steps or approvals, depending on the organization's policies.
```


#### Learn more around Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. In the context of Kubernetes, RBAC allows you to control who has access to the Kubernetes API and what they can do with those resources

- Rules: A rule is a set of operations (verbs) that can be carried out on a group of resources which belong to different API Groups.

##### kubectl explain role.rules 

```
kubectl explain role.rules     
GROUP:      rbac.authorization.k8s.io
KIND:       Role
VERSION:    v1

FIELD: rules <[]PolicyRule>

DESCRIPTION:
    Rules holds all the PolicyRules for this Role
    PolicyRule holds information that describes a policy rule, but does not
    contain information about who the rule applies to or which namespace the
    rule applies to.
    
FIELDS:
  apiGroups     <[]string>
    APIGroups is the name of the APIGroup that contains the resources.  If
    multiple API groups are specified, any action requested against one of the
    enumerated resources in any API group will be allowed. "" represents the
    core API group and "*" represents all API groups.

  nonResourceURLs       <[]string>
    NonResourceURLs is a set of partial urls that a user should have access to.
    *s are allowed, but only as the full, final step in the path Since
    non-resource URLs are not namespaced, this field is only applicable for
    ClusterRoles referenced from a ClusterRoleBinding. Rules can either apply to
    API resources (such as "pods" or "secrets") or non-resource URL paths (such
    as "/api"),  but not both.

  resourceNames <[]string>
    ResourceNames is an optional white list of names that the rule applies to.
    An empty set means that everything is allowed.

  resources     <[]string>
    Resources is a list of resources this rule applies to. '*' represents all
    resources.

  verbs <[]string> -required-
    Verbs is a list of Verbs that apply to ALL the ResourceKinds contained in
    this rule. '*' represents all verbs.

```

- Roles and ClusterRoles: Both consist of rules. The difference between a Role and a ClusterRole is the scope: in a Role, the rules are applicable to a single namespace, whereas a ClusterRole is cluster-wide, so the rules are applicable to more than one namespace. ClusterRoles can define rules for cluster-scoped resources (such as nodes) as well. Both Roles and ClusterRoles are mapped as API Resources inside our cluster.

- Subjects: These correspond to the entity that attempts an operation in the cluster. There are three types of subjects:

- User Accounts: These are global, and meant for humans or processes living outside the cluster. There is no associated resource API Object in the Kubernetes cluster.

- Service Accounts: This kind of account is namespaced and meant for intra-cluster processes running inside pods, which want to authenticate against the API.

- Groups: This is used for referring to multiple accounts. There are some groups created by default such as cluster-admin (explained in later sections).

- RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings: Just as the names imply, these bind subjects to roles (i.e. the operations a given user can perform). As for Roles and ClusterRoles, the difference lies in the scope: a RoleBinding will make the rules effective inside a namespace, whereas a ClusterRoleBinding will make the rules effective in all namespaces.

```
#### create new namespace 

```
kubernetesdaily.github.io git:(main) ✗ kubectl create namespace rbacminikube
namespace/rbacminikube created
```

Define a Role (nginx-role.yaml) that allows managing NGINX resources (pods and services) within the "rbacminikube" namespace:

### create new namespaces with name developement & qa 

```
➜  k8s git:(main) ✗ kubectl create namespace development
kubectl create namespace qa
namespace/development created
namespace/qa created
```

## Why Create Service Accounts?

- Process Identity: Service accounts provide an identity for processes that run in pods, enabling Kubernetes to apply RBAC rules to these processes.

- Scoped Access Control: By associating a service account with certain RBAC roles, you can control what actions the processes running under this account can perform in the Kubernetes cluster.

- Security Best Practices: Using distinct service accounts for different teams or applications is a security best practice. It prevents privilege escalation and limits the impact if a service account is compromised.

dev-service-account.yaml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: dev-team-sa
  namespace: development

```

qa-service-account.yaml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: qa-team-sa
  namespace: qa
```

admin-service-account.yaml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: admin-team-sa
  namespace: default  # or a specific admin namespace
```

### apply all service account 

```
kubectl apply -f dev-service-account.yaml
kubectl apply -f qa-service-account.yaml
kubectl apply -f admin-service-account.yaml
```



#### define role and Rolebindings

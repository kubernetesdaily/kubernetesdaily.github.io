##### Why does Kubernetes allow more than one container in a Pod
- Containers in a Pod runs on a "logical host": they use the same network namespace (same IP address and port space), they can use shared volumes
- using several containers for an application is simpler to use, more transparent, and allows decoupling software dependencies

##### Use Cases for Multi-Container Pods

The primary purpose of a multi-container Pod is to support co-located, co-managed helper processes for a main program

Sidecar containers:
"help" the main container. For example, log or data change watchers, monitoring adapters, and so on.
A log watcher, for example, can be built once by a different team and reused across different applications
Another example of a sidecar container is a file or data loader that generates data for the main container.

#### Communication Between Containers in a Pod

Shared volumes:
you can use a shared Kubernetes Volume as a simple and efficient way to share data between containers in a Pod.
Volumes enables data to survive container restarts. It has the same lifetime as a Pod.
it is sufficient to use a directory on the host that is shared with all containers within a Pod

- A standard use case for a multi-container Pod with shared Volume is when one container writes to the shared directory (logs or other files), and the other container reads from the shared directory
- The second container uses Debian image and has the shared volume mounted to the directory /html. The second container every second adds current date and time and into index.html that is located in the shared volume.
- Nginx servers reads this file and transfers it to the user for each HTTP request to the web server.

```sh
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mc1
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: html
    emptyDir: {}
  containers:
  - name: 1st
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: html
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  - name: 2nd
    image: debian
    volumeMounts:
    - name: html
      mountPath: /html
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
    args:
      - while true; do
          date >> /html/index.html;
          sleep 1;
        done

```

pod/mc1 created

```

#### Kubernetes has three Object Types you should know about:

- Pods - runs one or more closely related containers

- Services - sets up networking in a Kubernetes cluster

- Deployment - Maintains a set of identical pods, ensuring that they have the correct config and that the right number of them exist.

Pods:

- Runs a single set of containers
- Good for one-off dev purposes
- Rarely used directly in production

Deployment:

- Runs a set of identical pods
- Monitors the state of each pod, updating as necessary
- Good for dev
- Good for production


Pod templates : 

Controllers for workload resources create Pods from a pod template and manage those Pods on your behalf.

-PodTemplates are specifications for creating Pods, and are included in workload resources such as Deployments, Jobs, and DaemonSets.

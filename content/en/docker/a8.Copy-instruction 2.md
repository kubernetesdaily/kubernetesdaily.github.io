COPY is a dockerfile command that copies files from a local source location to a destination in the Docker container. A Dockerfile is a text file with instructions to set up a Docker container.

create myfile1.txt and myfile2.txt with following content :

```sh
# myfile1.txt
Hello This is my first file !
This is file will be copied in /usr/share directory from Docker host to Docker Container.
```

```sh
# myfile2.txt
Hello This is my second file !
This is file will be copied in /tmp directory from Docker host to Docker Container.

```
The general syntax of the COPY command is:

```sh
COPY <src> <dest>

```
Here, `<src>` and `<dest>`are file paths.` <src>` is the path to the source folder containing files to be copied. This option can be left empty to copy the contents of the current directory. The source of the files has to be a directory on the local computer.

`<dest>` is the destination of the COPY command inside the docker container. This is the path where files are to be copied.

```Dockerfile
# Instruction for Dockerfile to create a new image on top of the base image (ubuntu)
# Using the base image ubuntu: latest
FROM ubuntu:latest
# Copying myfile1.txt to the containers /usr/share directory
COPY myfile1.txt /usr/share
# Copying myfile2.txt to the containers /tmp directory
COPY myfile2.txt /tmp

```

 #### check inside container and search for text file 

```sh

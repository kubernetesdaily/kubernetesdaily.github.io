running `docker run alpine ` command would download the Alpine Linux image from Docker Hub and start a new container based on that image. You can then use the container to run commands or applications. When you exit the container, it will stop running.

Alpine Linux is a lightweight Linux distribution that is commonly used in Docker containers due to its small size and security features.

```sh
dockerworkshop git:(main) ✗ docker pull alpine:3.6 
docker pull alpine:3.7
docker pull alpine:3.8
docker pull alpine:3.9

#### docker images filtering 

The docker images command allows you to filter Docker images based on various criteria using the --filter option. Here are some common filters that you can use with the docker images command:


```sh
docker images --filter=reference='alpine'
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
alpine       3.9       9afdd4a290bf   2 years ago   5.3MB
alpine       3.8       b22edbe95d11   3 years ago   4.2MB
alpine       3.7       bd812700d284   3 years ago   4.01MB
alpine       3.6       25e814211fdd   3 years ago   3.84MB
```
#### Filters images that are or are not "dangling," meaning they are not tagged and not referenced by any container.

```sh
docker images --filter dangling=false 
```
Or to list images created before a specific image, you can run:

```sh
docker images --filter before=alpine:3.8 

```

#### Running a Docker Container with ENTRYPOINT

Let's learn the details in this case by actually executing ENTRYPOINT in exec form. The following is an example of a Dockerfile that uses the exec form of ENTRYPOINT, which outputs a character string on the command line.

```dockerfile 
FROM alpine
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello!"]

```

#### Build dockerfile 

```sh
➜  Dockerfile git:(main) ✗ docker build -t sangam14/entrypoint-dockerfile  -f dockerfile.entrypoint .

#### run docker container 

```sh
 Dockerfile git:(main) ✗ docker run sangam14/entrypoint-dockerfile 
Hello!
➜  Dockerfile git:(main) ✗ docker run sangam14/entrypoint-dockerfile echo "sangam"
Hello! echo sangam
➜  Dockerfile git:(main) ✗ 

```

#### Overwrite with `--entrypoint` option

On the other hand, in ENTRYPOINT, you can change the instruction by using the option of `—entrypoint` as follows.

```sh
docker run --rm --entrypoint sh sangam14/entrypoint-dockerfile  -c 'echo "test"'
test

```

CMD and ENTRYPOINT have similar roles and are confusing, but they have different functions. CMD, ENTRYPOINT, and ENTRYPOINT also behave differently between shell form and exec form, so it's a good idea to use each function properly. The instructions in the Dockerfile are a bit complicated, but you can use them effectively if you understand them.

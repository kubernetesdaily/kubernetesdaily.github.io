      description: Rust emphasizes memory safety without using a garbage collector. It achieves this through its unique ownership model, which helps prevent common memory-related errors like buffer overflows..

    - title: Concurrency
      icon: settings_input_component
      description: Rust's ownership and type systems make concurrent programming more manageable and less prone to errors, allowing for safe and efficient execution of parallel code.

    - title: Performance
      icon: speed
      description: As a systems programming language, Rust offers performance similar to C and C++. It's designed for speed and efficiency, making it ideal for performance-critical applications.

    - title: Zero-Cost Abstractions
      icon: memory
      description: Rust provides high-level abstractions without sacrificing performance. Its zero-cost abstractions mean you don't pay a runtime cost for using higher-level features.

    - title: Modern Tooling
      icon: build
      description: Rust has a modern toolchain including Cargo (its package manager), a built-in test framework, and excellent documentation, enhancing developer productivity and ease of use..

    - title: Cross-Platform Compatibility
      icon: devices
      description: "Rust supports cross-platform development, making it easier to write code that runs on multiple operating systems and architectures"

    - title: Vibrant Community
      icon: people
      description: Rust has a rapidly growing, active community. This leads to a rich ecosystem of libraries (crates), tools, and resources for developers.

    - title: WebAssembly (Wasm) Support
      icon: web
      description: Rust has first-class support for WebAssembly, a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. This makes Rust an ideal choice for building high-performance web applications and allows code written in Rust to be run in web browsers at near-native speed.

    - title: Active Development and Corporate Support
      icon: build
      description: Rust is under active development with contributions from individuals and companies. Big tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are increasingly investing in Rust, showing its growing importance in the industry.

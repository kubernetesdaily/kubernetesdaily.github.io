### How K8sGPT works ?

K8sGPT uses analyzers to triage and diagnose issues in your cluster. It has a set of analyzers that are built in, but you will be able to write your own analyzers.

Built in analyzers

Enabled by default

- podAnalyzer 
  https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt/blob/main/pkg/analyzer/pod.go
   - search all namespaces for pods that are not running
   - Check through container status to check for crashes or unready
   - a container that is still being created or blocked due to conditions such as OOMKilled
   - when pod is Running but its ReadinessProbe fails

- pvcAnalyzer  
   - PersistentVolumeClaim.ObjectMeta 
   - Error: value.FailureDetails
- rsAnalyzer
   - Status of replicaset 
   - type of event 
   - reason of failure 

  ```
   Events:
  Type    Reason            Age   From                   Message
  ----    ------            ----  ----                   -------
  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  117s  replicaset-controller  Created pod: frontend-wtsmm
  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  116s  replicaset-controller  Created pod: frontend-b2zdv
  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  116s  replicaset-controller  Created pod: frontend-vcmts
  ```
- serviceAnalyzer
  - Service existed or not 
  - Service has not ready endpoints 
- eventAnalyzer
   - the function loops through the list of events to find the most recent one. It initializes a pointer to the latest event as nil, and then compares each event's LastTimestamp field to the current latest event's LastTimestamp. If the current event has a later LastTimestamp, the function updates the latestEvent pointer to point to that event instead.

   - Finally, the function returns a pointer to the latest event found, or an error if there was a problem fetching the events from the Kubernetes API.

  - Overall, this function is useful for retrieving the most recent event associated with a Kubernetes object, which can be helpful in monitoring and troubleshooting the state of Kubernetes resources.

- ingressAnalyzer
   - checks if the Ingress is using TLS encryption and extracts the list of hostnames associated with the Ingress.
   - implementation is specifically responsible for extracting and organizing relevant information from Kubernetes Ingress resources to generate descriptions about them.
- statefulSetAnalyzer
   - check StatefulSet uses the service namespace and servicename which does not exist 
   - The volumeClaimTemplates will provide stable storage using PersistentVolumes provisioned by a PersistentVolume Provisioner.

- deploymentAnalyzer
  - DeploymentAnalyzer is an analyzer that checks for misconfigured Deployments from all namespaces
- cronJobAnalyzer
  - Check CRON schedule format
- networkPolicyAnalyzer
  -  Check if policy allows traffic to all pods in the namespace
  -  Check if policy is not applied to any pods
- nodeAnalyzer

> Conditions

The conditions field describes the status of all Running nodes. Examples of conditions include:

| Node Condition | Description |
| ---------------|-------------- |
| Ready |	True if the node is healthy and ready to accept pods, False if the node is not healthy and is not accepting pods, and Unknown if the node controller has not heard from the node in the last node-monitor-grace-period (default is 40 seconds) |
| DiskPressure |	True if pressure exists on the disk size—that is, if the disk capacity is low; otherwise False |
| MemoryPressure | True if pressure exists on the node memory—that is, if the node memory is low; otherwise False |
| PIDPressure | True if pressure exists on the processes—that is, if there are too many processes on the node; otherwise False | 
NetworkUnavailable	| True if the network for the node is not correctly configured, otherwise False |



  - In the Kubernetes API, a node's condition is represented as part of the .status of the Node resource. For example, the following JSON structure describes a healthy node:

```
  "conditions": [
  {
    "type": "Ready",
    "status": "True",
    "reason": "KubeletReady",
    "message": "kubelet is posting ready status",
    "lastHeartbeatTime": "2023-06-05T18:38:35Z",
    "lastTransitionTime": "2023-06-05T11:41:27Z"
  }
]

```

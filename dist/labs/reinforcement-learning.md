# Reinforcement Learning Lab

## Overview
The Reinforcement Learning Lab focuses on developing intelligent agents that learn optimal decision-making strategies through interaction with their environment. Our research spans from foundational algorithms to cutting-edge applications in robotics, game-playing, recommendation systems, and more.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Algorithms
- **Value-based methods**: Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and their variants
- **Policy optimization**: Policy gradients, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
- **Model-based RL**: Learning environment dynamics for planning and simulation

### 2. Advanced Techniques
- **Multi-agent systems**: Cooperative and competitive learning in shared environments
- **Offline RL**: Learning from fixed datasets without active environment interaction
- **Exploration strategies**: Intrinsic motivation, curiosity-driven learning, and uncertainty estimation

### 3. Real-world Applications
- **Robotics**: Sample-efficient learning for physical systems with safety constraints
- **Recommendation systems**: Sequential decision-making for user engagement
- **Resource optimization**: Energy management, traffic control, and logistics

## Current Progress
- Completed: Foundation RL algorithms library, simulation environments, benchmarking tools

# LLM Evaluation Framework

## Overview

This lab develops comprehensive methodologies, benchmarks, and tools for evaluating large language models across multiple dimensions. We aim to create standardized, open-source evaluation frameworks that assess not only capabilities but also safety, reliability, and alignment with human values. Our work supports researchers, developers, and end-users in understanding model strengths, limitations, and appropriate use cases.

## Goals

- Create a multifaceted evaluation framework covering diverse capabilities and safety concerns
- Develop tools that enable consistent, reproducible evaluations of language models
- Build comprehensive benchmarks across languages, domains, and task types
- Establish standards for responsible evaluation and reporting of model performance
- Foster a community of practice around rigorous LLM evaluation

## Methodology

Our approach encompasses multiple evaluation dimensions:

### Capability Assessment

- **Foundation capabilities**: Understanding, reasoning, knowledge recall, and instruction following
- **Domain expertise**: Performance across specialized domains (medicine, law, programming, etc.)
- **Multilingual proficiency**: Capabilities across diverse languages and cultural contexts
- **Multimodal reasoning**: Evaluation of text-image-audio understanding and generation

### Safety and Reliability

- **Harmfulness detection**: Measuring models' propensity to generate harmful content
- **Hallucination metrics**: Quantifying factual accuracy and fabrication
- **Robustness testing**: Evaluating performance under adversarial conditions
- **Alignment measurement**: Assessing adherence to human values and instructions

### Meta-evaluation

- **Evaluation quality**: Creating metrics to assess the quality of evaluations themselves
- **Reproducibility**: Ensuring consistent results across evaluation runs
- **Transparency**: Documenting evaluation methodologies and limitations
- **Cost efficiency**: Developing resource-efficient evaluation strategies

## Current Progress

We have made significant progress on several fronts:

1. **Multidimensional Benchmark Suite**: Created a collection of tasks covering 12 capability dimensions
2. **Open Evaluator Framework**: Developed an extensible framework for running evaluations
3. **Factuality Assessment Tools**: Built specialized tools for measuring hallucination and factual accuracy
4. **Cross-model Comparison Database**: Established a repository of standardized evaluation results

Our current work focuses on expanding language coverage, improving meta-evaluation metrics, and developing domain-specific evaluation suites.

# Contributing to AIData Foundation Labs

We love your input! We want to make contributing to AIData Foundation labs as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Adding or updating documentation
- Creating new lab projects

## How to Contribute

### Contributing Content via Markdown

Most of our lab content is stored in Markdown files, making it easy for anyone to contribute without needing to understand the codebase. Here's how to do it:

1. **Find the lab you want to contribute to** in our repository under the `/public/labs/` directory
2. **Fork the repository** so you have your own copy to work on
3. **Edit the relevant Markdown files** in your fork
4. **Submit a pull request** so we can review your changes

### Standard Markdown Structure

We use a standard structure for our lab markdown files to ensure consistency:

```markdown
# Lab Title

## Overview
Brief description of what this lab is about

## Goals
- Clear, bullet-pointed goals
- What this lab aims to achieve

## Methodology
How the work is being approached

## Current Progress
Status updates and findings

## How to Contribute

## Resources

### Creating a New Lab

To propose a new lab:

1. **Create a new markdown file** in the `/public/labs/` directory
2. **Name it descriptively** (e.g., `semantic-search-evaluation.md`)
3. **Follow the standard structure** above
4. **Submit a pull request** with a description of why this lab is valuable

## Code Contributions

For contributions that involve code changes to the website itself:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md or documentation with details of changes if applicable
2. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer
3. If you don't have permission to merge, the project maintainers will merge it for you

## Community Guidelines

To create a positive environment for everyone:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members
